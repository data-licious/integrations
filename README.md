# Static HTML pages required to test SuperTag integrations

### HOWTO:

1. Create new file in the root folder, e.g. `disqus.html` and commit it in the `gh-pages` branch (`gh-pages` is the only branch in this repo).
2. That's it after few second your file will be hosted on GitHub's CDN and available under the urls http://data-licious.github.io/integrations/disqus and http://data-licious.github.io/integrations/disqus.html and also you can use `https`.
